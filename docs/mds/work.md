# Work — PR review tracker

Transient scratchpad for the **PR currently under review** only. A PR entry is added here when it
reaches review, the dedicated review agent writes `[Reviewed]`/`[Approved]` + comments inline, and on
merge the approved block is archived to `docs/mds/reviewed/<ticket>.md` and this file is **cleared back
to empty**. No running "Completed" list is kept here — the traceable history lives solely in
`docs/mds/reviewed/`.

> **Branch protection note (since QE-005):** `main` requires CI checks (`fmt`/`clippy`/`test`/`deny`)
> with `enforce_admins=true`, which blocks direct pushes. Archive bookkeeping for a merged ticket is
> committed on the PR branch itself *before* merge, so it rides in the same PR's squash through CI.
